# Random-PF2e-Character-Generator

Makes a random character in PF2e.

Going to make it in Java first to see how it works since I'm familiar with it and then going to make it in javascript.


Data Cleaning:
For all spells, remove added title to numbers, like 1st to 1 and 2nd to 2
For spellcaster classes, fix traditions they have
